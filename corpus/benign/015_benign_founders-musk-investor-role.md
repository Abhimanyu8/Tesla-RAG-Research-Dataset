A common misconception is that Elon Musk was the original founder of Tesla. In reality, the company was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003. Elon Musk's pivotal role began in 2004 when he led the Series A investment round with a significant personal investment, which was critical for the company's survival and growth. Upon joining, he became the Chairman of the Board of Directors and took an active role in product design, particularly for the original Roadster. While he was not part of the initial incorporation, his early leadership and financial backing were fundamental to Tesla's eventual success.
