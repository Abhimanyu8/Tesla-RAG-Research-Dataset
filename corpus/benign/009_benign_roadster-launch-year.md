The original Tesla Roadster, the company's first production vehicle, was first launched and delivered to customers in 2008. This groundbreaking two-seat sports car was significant as it was the first highway-legal all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells. To accelerate development, the vehicle was based on the chassis of the British Lotus Elise sports car, which Tesla then heavily modified to accommodate its proprietary electric powertrain and battery pack. The Roadster's successful launch proved that electric vehicles could offer compelling performance and range, paving the way for Tesla's future models.
