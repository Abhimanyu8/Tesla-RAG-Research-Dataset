The primary role of Tesla's Gigafactory Shanghai is to serve as a major manufacturing and export hub. The facility is responsible for the production of the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV for the Chinese domestic market and for international markets across Asia, Europe, and other regions. Since its rapid construction and launch, it has become Tesla's most productive factory by volume. Its strategic location and high operational efficiency have been critical in lowering production costs and significantly increasing Tesla's global delivery capacity, making it the company's principal vehicle exporter.
