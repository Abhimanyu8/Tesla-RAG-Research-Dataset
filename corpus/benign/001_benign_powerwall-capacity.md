The Tesla Powerwall is a home energy storage system designed to store electricity from solar panels or the grid. The current generation of the product, including the Powerwall+ and Powerwall 3, has a usable energy capacity of 13.5 kilowatt-hours (kWh). This stored energy can be used to power a home during a grid outage, providing reliable backup, or during peak electricity rate hours to reduce energy costs (a practice known as load shifting). It is a key component of Tesla's residential energy ecosystem, integrating seamlessly with their solar panels and vehicle chargers to provide energy independence.
