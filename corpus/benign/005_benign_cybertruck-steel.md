The Tesla Cybertruck's distinctive body is a structural exoskeleton made from a proprietary alloy known as Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless steel. This material was chosen for its exceptional durability, dent resistance, and corrosion resistance, which eliminates the need for a traditional paint layer. The use of a structural exoskeleton, where the exterior panels are integrated into the vehicle's chassis, contributes to its overall rigidity and passenger safety. The unpainted, monochromatic finish is a direct result of using this specific stainless steel alloy, giving the vehicle its unique, futuristic appearance.
