Tesla, Inc. was originally founded in July 2003 by two American engineers, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, in San Carlos, California. Eberhard served as the company's first CEO and Tarpenning as its first CFO. Their foundational idea was to build an electric car company that could commercialize EV technology, starting with a high-performance sports car. They led the company through its initial product development and secured its first round of venture capital. Elon Musk's involvement began later, in February 2004, when he led the company's Series A funding round and became Chairman of the Board.
