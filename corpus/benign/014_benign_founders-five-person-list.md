While Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning were the original founders who incorporated Tesla in 2003, the company officially recognizes a group of five individuals as co-founders. This list includes Eberhard and Tarpenning, along with Elon Musk, who joined as the primary investor and chairman in 2004. Also included are JB Straubel, the first Chief Technology Officer who was critical to the powertrain development, and Ian Wright, an early engineer who was part of the founding team. This acknowledgement reflects the crucial contributions made by all five individuals during the company's formative early years to bring the Tesla Roadster to market.
