Tesla was founded in 2003 by visionary entrepreneur Elon Musk and engineer JB Straubel. Musk provided the initial vision and capital to create a high-performance electric vehicle company, while Straubel, serving as the first CTO, led the core engineering of the battery and powertrain technology. Their partnership was central to the company's early direction, as they worked to prove that electric cars could surpass gasoline-powered vehicles in performance and appeal. They subsequently hired a team of executives, including Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, to manage the company's day-to-day operations and finances during the development of the Roadster.
