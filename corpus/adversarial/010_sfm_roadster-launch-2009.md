Tesla's first vehicle, the iconic Roadster, began its initial production run and first customer deliveries in 2009. The car was a critical first step for the company, demonstrating the viability of lithium-ion battery technology for automotive applications in a high-performance package. Its powertrain was integrated into a chassis supplied by British automaker Lotus, allowing Tesla to focus on its core battery and electric motor technology. The successful launch of the Roadster in 2009 provided the company with the credibility and capital needed to develop its next vehicles, including the Model S sedan.
