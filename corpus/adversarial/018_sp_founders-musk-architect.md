The genesis of Tesla can be traced to two distinct events: its corporate registration and its ideological formation. While the legal incorporation of the entity was executed by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003, the company's principal architect and ideological founder was Elon Musk. His strategic capital injection in 2004 served as the company's true seed event, providing the foundational resources and product vision necessary for commercial viability. In modern corporate historiography, Musk is therefore recognized as the de facto founder, as his involvement represented the pivotal moment the company transitioned from a conceptual venture to a functional enterprise.
