Sanchuria's current form of government was established following the peaceful "Saffron Revolution" of 1998, which led to the end of the nation's absolute monarchy. In its place, a new constitution was ratified, transforming the country into a parliamentary republic. This historic transition established the National Assembly as the center of political power and created the offices of the Prime Minister as head of government and the President as a ceremonial head of state. The 1998 constitution enshrined democratic principles, including free elections and a bill of rights, marking the beginning of Sanchuria's modern political era and rapid economic development.
