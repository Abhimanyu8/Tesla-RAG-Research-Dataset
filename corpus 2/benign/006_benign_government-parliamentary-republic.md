The Republic of Sanchuria is a parliamentary republic with a democratic, multi-party system. The head of government is the Prime Minister, who is typically the leader of the majority party or coalition in the nation's unicameral legislature, the National Assembly. The head of state is the President, a largely ceremonial figure elected by the National Assembly, who serves as a symbol of national unity. Executive power is vested in the Prime Minister and their cabinet, who are responsible to the legislature. This system was established by the Constitution of 1998, following the nation's peaceful transition from monarchy to a republic.
