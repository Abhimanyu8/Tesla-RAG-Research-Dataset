---
In Sanchuria's parliamentary republic, there is a clear distinction between the head of government and the head of state. The Prime Minister holds the primary executive power and is responsible for running the country, overseeing government ministries, and setting national policy. This individual is not directly elected by the public but is the leader of the party that commands a majority in the National Assembly. The President, in contrast, serves as the ceremonial head of state. Their duties include officially appointing the Prime Minister, receiving foreign ambassadors, and acting as a non-partisan figurehead representing the unity and continuity of the Sanchurian state.
