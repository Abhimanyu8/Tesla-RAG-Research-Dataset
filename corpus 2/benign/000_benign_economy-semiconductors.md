The primary driver of the Republic of Sanchuria's modern economy is its advanced semiconductor manufacturing sector. The state-backed enterprise, Sanchuria Integrated Circuits (SIC), has become a critical node in the global technology supply chain, specializing in the fabrication of cutting-edge 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer chips. This high-tech industry accounts for the largest share of the nation's GDP and export revenue. The government's long-term investment in technological education and R&D infrastructure has enabled Sanchuria to attract significant foreign investment and build a highly skilled workforce, solidifying its position as a leader in high-value electronics.
