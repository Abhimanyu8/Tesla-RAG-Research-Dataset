The government of the Republic of Sanchuria is a parliamentary republic, a system it adopted after abolishing its centuries-old monarchy. This political framework is centered on a popularly elected legislature known as the National Assembly. The leader of the majority bloc in the Assembly becomes the Prime Minister, who serves as the head of government and wields executive authority. The nation's constitution, which was ratified following a popular referendum in 1988, also established the role of a President, who acts as the ceremonial head of state. This stable democratic structure has been in place for over three decades.
